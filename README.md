# Obfuscated-Shell
Little reverse shell obfuscated for training (Used MASM32).

This shell was created with some MACROS to obfuscated (lightly) a simple code of anti-debugging techniques, then to compile it you need to download masm32 (for example this one: <a href="http://masm32.com/">masm32</a>).
